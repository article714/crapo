# CrAPO: Workflow engine for Odoo

## Getting started with Crapo

The **Crapo** project has been started in an attempt to provide an efficient replacement to Odoo's workflow engine that has been retired since 11.0.

We provide a compleete framework to automate business process and enable state management & automation in Odoo.

## Concepts

**Crapo** uses two major concepts for state management/process automation:

- _Automaton_: a state-machine that describes and automates the various transitions between states of a given business object class (i.e. Odoo Model)
- _Workflow_: a workflow coordinates and automates a set of activities that can apply to a whole set of business objects
